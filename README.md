# christmass-lights-v2
This is the second breadboarding project I did when I got into breadboarding. It was around Christmass time and I thought it would be cool to show family at parties.
## Instalation
Download Arduino IDE for your system and make a sketch. Copy the code from Xmas-Lights-v2.ino into the sketch. Connect the board to your device and install the program on the arduino. Known to work with Arduino Uno Rev3. (I used a branded version of the Rev3 from a strange coding kit I got a while ago)
